    - You trust her?
    - I do.
    - who cooks in your house?
    - I do
    - Do you use spoons?
    - I do
    - and what I'm thinking actually is when we take medications they say take- to take 10 milliliters which is like a cup full of that medicine bottle if you halve that. But I'm not completely certain to be honest
    - Think we should ask for help?
    - because it tablespoon dessert spoon, and soup spoon are very similar in size
    - They're roughly the same, I agree with that
    - Um yeah you just you wouldn't usually use them for measuring.
    - Pirouette is when you turn in ballet
    - But you did French
    - A long time ago
    - again, that's the one I would think is, pirouette is turning round isn't it it's
    - not gonna be the others
    - it's like the word spiral would be turning round so that that makes sense

    - He's the man?
    - He's the man.
    - Lewis
    - He's sure.

    - I mean, it feels right
    - I don't know
    - Seb is looking terribly pleased with life
    - I'm not sure but it's, it's uh, it's
    - but uh, you do seem to know

    - And how long was Robson there?
    - Until the, the present manager
    - He wasn't there since nineteen-ninety-seven, was he?
    - It's a five year thing
    - That's it
    - I, I don't think Ruud Gullit was manager for five years
    - Let's go fifty-fifty
    - Okay, computer take away two random answers, leave Tim and Terrie the right answer and one of the wrong ones
    - These questions are too easy
    - I doubt that
    - I don't know
    - Why do you think it might be Reagan?
    - Well, he's, he is a fairly physical, fit guy, went on to become an actor
    - who would know would anybody know, phone a friend wise
    - There might two.
    - Or the audience?
    - I want to leave the really difficult ones for the audience
    - We'd probably need to phone a friend, wouldn't we? To stay alive
    - Who's likely to know, Jeremy, Jeremy Bryant likely to know this?
    - I don't know, would he know?
    - What about your lady?
    - Judith?
    - Do you, do you think, we should ask the audience? Get a feel for it
    - And then, it it's still not convicing, phone a friend
    - Okay, see what the audience thinks
    - all vote now
    - How good do you feel about that?
    - Well, it's
    - it's a doubt, it's a doubt, I'm sure the, uh, the audience are doubtful as well
    - Ahh, we've got to stay in the game, haven't we?
    - Oh, take your time sir
    - O'Brien! I've hung around long enough here with you

    - South Pacific, there is nothing like a day
    - How's your greek, tim?
    - Terrible
    - Uhm
    - We'd regret it for the rest of our lives if it did turn out to be heat and we said, we said, no, we're not gonna take the 64 thousand
    - Well, my gut feeling is what your gut feeling is, but it is a guess
    - Mhm

    - Neville Chamberlain was once and he was there from all he had to do
    - yes 80% I'm 80% there
    - but I could be wrong and if I'm wrong I apologize

    - Would you risk it if it were your own money
    - Yes
    - Yes I would
    - It sounds English doesn't it

    - But it could be Crichton
    - If we go out boss remember you chose B
    - Yeah, well I don't know, is it
    - Mel Gibson was in the film
    - That convinces me
    - I have no idea

    - they wouldn't have the euro if they have got the world cup final, they wouldn't have it
    - they are not neighbouring I dont' if that makes a difference
    - and why would you go to Liechtenstein?
    - they only got one stadium
    - wasn't Liechtenstein the country that England played and they were drafting and it was gonna be
    - it's whether it's Germany
    - why?
    - because
    - because the Germans wouldn't share it with anybody
    - I don't know like you but it's the logical answer
    - yeah, doesn't mean it's the right answer
    - no
    - that's obviously a ladies question so
    - oh no
    - I'm sorry I'm sorry
    - can I just say that I think we both obviously feels sport could be a strong point and as it has come so early in the day that's not really great for us is it
    - you think we peaked too early?
    - I think so
    - might I?
    - I would be in trouble if I got that one wrong
