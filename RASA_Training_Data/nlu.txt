    - I do
    - Do you use spoons?

    - Think we should ask for help?
    - because it tablespoon dessert spoon, and soup spoon are very similar in size

    - Seb is looking terribly pleased with life
    - I'm not sure but it's, it's uh, it's
    - but uh, you do seem to know

    - I don't know, would he know?
    - What about your lady?
    - Judith?
    - Do you, do you think, we should ask the audience? Get a feel for it
    - And then, it it's still not convicing, phone a friend
    - Okay, see what the audience thinks
    - all vote now
    - How good do you feel about that?
    - Well, it's
    - it's a doubt, it's a doubt, I'm sure the, uh, the audience are doubtful as well
