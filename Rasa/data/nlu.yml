    - To make brass rubbings
    - I know what I think it is but I'm not absolutely definite
    - I do.
    - I do
    - I do
    - and what I'm thinking actually is when we take medications they say take- to take 10 milliliters which is like a cup full of that medicine bottle if you halve that. But I'm not completely certain to be honest
    - Think we should ask for help?
    - because it tablespoon dessert spoon, and soup spoon are very similar in size
    - They're roughly the same, I agree with that
    - Um yeah you just you wouldn't usually use them for measuring.
    - Pirouette is when you turn in ballet
    - But you did French
    - A long time ago
    - again, that's the one I would think is, pirouette is turning round isn't it it's
    - not gonna be the others
    - it's like the word spiral would be turning round so that that makes sense
    - none of the others are in Texas. I didn't know it was a port but

    - Exactly, I've watched that, I haven't watch Mary Poppins
    - We should play this one
    - I think we should play this one
    - But I, I honestly don't know
    - Can I say a silly thing?
    - Please
    - She doesn't look Italian
    - She looks Greek?
    - In a weird sort of way
    - I mean I just don't think she looks Italian but I don't know
    - So, possibly Greece or possibly Italy
    - Was the Italian thing just you vaguely remember reading something about her or
    - Yea but it's, it's vague so I wouldn't want to I wouldn't want to stake 32,000 pounds on it
    - I think that they're quite buddy with our royal family and Philip is, of course, Greek.
    - I think you should go with your hunch
    - Right, and it's purely a hunch
    - Well, in my fruit basket it would probably be apples
    - oh hang on, oh I don't know exactly
    - I've never heard of paddling birds, as in being described as paddlers
    - splashers, ploughers, waders, I mean that is the generic bird term.

    - You're sure of this
    - well I've never heard of an americano water
    - That sounds very definite, yes
    - I am fewer
    - No

    - Uh, I'm not, no, I don't know, I have no idea
    - I wouldn't risk it on what I know about that

    - Yeah
    - You're more likely to know than I am
    - Georgette, Georgette
    - Ohh
    - Ih, Ih, It's not, hm-hm
    - it's not Turin and it's not Bologna
    - It's not Turin, it's not Bologna
    - Tuscany, Toscana. I broke the world record in Florence. I should know this.
    - But I'm no absolutely certain, but it, I'm pretty sure it's Florence. But it's a lot to drop, isn't it? Sixteen down to one, and we got sixteen.
    - It is, I suppose it depends on how positive we feel about it really, oh
    - I mean, it feels right
    - I don't know
    - I'm not sure but it's, it's uh, it's
    - but uh, you do seem to know
    - Do you think?
    - Fantastic
    - We could drop to thirty-two and we've got 64 and it wasn't astronomy, certainly not acting I don't think was medicine.
    - yes Mortimer wheeler is an archaeologist, was
    - yes, he, he is an archeologist, was
    - Because he's a Lord

    - Well, Kevin Keegan, when was Kevin Keegan manager of newcastle
    - Well, he was, and so was Ruud Gullit
    - Ruud Gullit, yeah
    - Ahh

    - And how long was Robson there?
    - Until the, the present manager
    - He wasn't there since nineteen-ninety-seven, was he?
    - It's a five year thing
    - That's it
    - I, I don't think Ruud Gullit was manager for five years
    - Let's go fifty-fifty
    - These questions are too easy
    - I don't know
    - Well, he's, he is a fairly physical, fit guy, went on to become an actor
    - who would know would anybody know, phone a friend wise
    - There might two.
    - Or the audience?
    - I want to leave the really difficult ones for the audience
    - We'd probably need to phone a friend, wouldn't we? To stay alive
    - Who's likely to know, Jeremy, Jeremy Bryant likely to know this?
    - I don't know, would he know?
    - What about your lady?
    - Judith?
    - Do you, do you think, we should ask the audience? Get a feel for it
    - And then, it it's still not convicing, phone a friend
    - Okay, see what the audience thinks
    - How good do you feel about that?
    - Well, it's
    - it's a doubt, it's a doubt, I'm sure the, uh, the audience are doubtful as well
    - Ahh, we've got to stay in the game, haven't we?
    - O'Brien! I've hung around long enough here with you
    - South Pacific, there is nothing like a day
    - How's your greek, tim?
    - Terrible
    - Uhm
    - We'd regret it for the rest of our lives if it did turn out to be heat and we said, we said, no, we're not gonna take the 64 thousand
    - Well, my gut feeling is what your gut feeling is, but it is a guess
    - Mhm
    - If we lose, we go down to 32,000 still a lot of money,
    - Oh what shame, Oh what a shame

    - the russian salvation army
    - keep that's castle keep

    - Neville Chamberlain was once and he was there from all he had to do
    - yes 80% I'm 80% there
    - but I could be wrong and if I'm wrong I apologize

    - I recomment it
    - I don't know
    - Great
    - Nor do I
    - It's going well
    - We can keep our 16,000

    - Yes it would be exciting
    - Would you risk it if it were your own money
    - Yes
    - Yes I would
    - It sounds English doesn't it
    - It's an English sounding thing that doesn't help
    - Should we beg forgiveness in advance and and risk it
