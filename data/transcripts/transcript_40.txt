U1: over a decade bringing us the itv []
U1: national news before switching to the []
U1: BBC two years ago so I presented okay []

U1: from the BBC to ITV she now appears on []
U1: the ITV News Channel Angela made British []
U1: Broadcasting history by becoming the []
U1: first female TV newsreader ever though []

U1: spend any money at all on advertising I []
