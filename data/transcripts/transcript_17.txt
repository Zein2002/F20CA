U1: it will be ignore mineus if it's []
U1: absolutely just a kind of 50/50 get in []
U1: your head I think we should phone a []
U1: friend because because otherwise we've []
U1: only got a 50-50 chance at the 18 gram []
U1: without being a setting up rules about []
U1: you're just friends I mean of course I []
U1: do have a friend who you think would []
U1: know that's my problem []

U1: it 50 50 even []
U1: you're not really any idea that's quite []
U1: a lot of money's gamble on it is it is []
U1: but you know the idea of making []
U1: Childline 32000 still having a friend to []
U1: take back or just having a grand oh it's []
U1: only cold but you're doing the classic []
U1: you're saving your life loafer later if []
U1: you get it wrong there won't be a later []
U1: I know we would throw 15,000 away if we []
U1: get this wrong yes we would win an extra []
U1: 69s if we get it right with the chance []
U1: of going on which we might not get []
