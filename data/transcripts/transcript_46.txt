U1: minute these films do you know any on []
U1: have you ever you're anything about any []
U1: of them all I know is that mrs. Miniver []
U1: rings a bell whether it's a filmic Bell []

U1: some extent swayed by your had your []
U1: extrasensory perceptions been right []
U1: several times too big as it should be []
U1: not drift lee miss miniver's direction []
U1: it in a way there's simply because []
U1: that's I might be completely wrong but []
U1: because that occurred to me that this is []
U1: a scintilla of a reason perhaps to []
U1: prefer mrs. Miniver should we try what []
U1: did someone mrs. Miniver Stella []
U1: starring Greer Garson what accents that []
U1: I don't know []
U1: slight tablet that was it help []
