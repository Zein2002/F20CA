U1: mean you have to wear []
U1: body armor and the whole lot don't you []
U1: which actually must make []
U1: doing your job very difficult i mean []
U1: just the physicality of it you can't you []
U1: can't []
U1: work efficiently with all this gear on []
U1: no i mean especially with the a []
U1: e teams on the back of the helicopters []
U1: um because they're actually collecting []
U1: patients from the front lines they've []
U1: got []
U1: full body armor helmets sometimes []
U1: weapons with them []
U1: it does make it very difficult to to []
U1: give the care at times but []
U1: but then we have training to do it and []
U1: you're trained to do it with this []
U1: you know the limitations that you've got []
U1: to make sure you can []
U1: do the job to an excellent presumably []
U1: then if there's like an all clear you []
U1: can you can reduce what you're what []
U1: you're wearing or whatever []
U1: yes yeah on the actual camp you only []
U1: wear the body armor and helmet when []

U1: iowa []
U1: is that a state i don't know []
U1: good answer though so that's two or []

U1: we could 50 50 and then phone with it []
U1: it's easier to choose between []
U1: two numbers isn't it if we were to ask []
U1: somebody else []
U1: i think so because if if like it if it []
U1: leaves us with []
U1: two and five for example and []
U1: they can count to three that there's []
U1: three in their head then we're going to []
U1: know it's []
U1: five whereas otherwise it could still be []
U1: three four five because they're very []
U1: small []
U1: there's only one number between each one []
U1: isn't it should we do that then 50 50 []
U1: first []
U1: yeah and see if that helps yeah []
U1: okay right computer take away two random []
U1: wrong answers lee []
