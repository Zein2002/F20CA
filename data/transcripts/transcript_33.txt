U1: have an inkling not how suppose I put it []
U1: another month actually I do not I think []
U1: we should do I think we should go 5050 []
U1: and then ask the audience because I []
U1: think we'll get a clear result that way []
U1: but I mean I'm not a clue okay so what []
U1: people do agree 5050 and then lastly []
U1: audience yeah that's not what I plan to []
U1: do bad thing okay yeah okay that all []
U1: right 50 cent degrees okay computer take []
U1: away two random role answers we've []
U1: written due to the right answer and the []
U1: one remaining wrong []
U1: well just have to hope but the audience []
U1: has good morning thing than we do if []
U1: it's very tight if the result comes []
U1: through very tight we should take the []
U1: money yeah it has to be a clear clear []
U1: decision tonight []
U1: yeah yeah okay okay we'll not I'll field []
U1: Institute okay audience good luck []
U1: everybody on your key passes for 32,000 []
U1: fans this is the question in which month []
U1: is International Women's Day held a []
U1: January or be March it's serious money []
U1: is for 32 thousand pounds all vote now []
U1: climbing to earth well okay it's a risk []
U1: we may go down to 1,000 pounds []
U1: but given that 90% offers blue I would []
U1: have said March so align all they're []
U1: going to do because it's a huge risk []
U1: it's a huge risk about the odds are good []
U1: I mean 90% we be I mean with ask the []
U1: audience right and nine out of 10 have []
U1: said March I mean I think that's you []
U1: can't if we could go down to a thousand []
U1: pounds we went on the wrong thing we'd []
U1: be mad not it's not but if we're wrong []
U1: we're wrong but you know we've []
U1: publicized the charities and we've got []
U1: them five hundred pounds each so 90 []
U1: percent yep degree yeah we do we might []
U1: lose another okay for my answer will do []
U1: do you happy with this at all for that []
U1: were there I did think March but that's []
U1: just sheer a sort of guesswork and []
U1: instinct I can't back it up with any []
U1: sense so []
U1: all right we're just coming the audience []
U1: seemed pretty certain that is a if []
U1: they're all guessing then that's a []
U1: really weird skewed result so I don't []
U1: think the Argos and I think a lot []
U1: unknown so we just have to play that fun []
U1: go from final ads will play yep pretty []
U1: much []
U1: because 132 []
U1: how did you know that you know right on []
U1: audience apparently much the eighth is []
U1: International Women's Day Wow Judy I []
U1: have never seen you so lost for words []
U1: you go it was in October no you go I'm []
U1: moving yeah great it's a great result []
U1: actually we're very very happy with that []
U1: whoo []
U1: but that's it all lifelines gone yeah []
U1: yeah oh you used your lifelines to get []
U1: there but I thought the way you played []
U1: this is actually very clever because was []
U1: that reducing the odds for the audience []
U1: all yeah yeah up yours take it good girl []
U1: okay I've always wanted you to do that []
U1: 16 grand a charity []
U1: yeah that's fantastic tax free that's []
U1: right absolutely right you hold it okay []
U1: how it normally works what you sort of []
U1: ultimately hand you over the money oh []
U1: right you have 32,000 pounds which is []
U1: great you are five away from 1 million []
U1: you have no lifelines you certainly []
U1: might as well play the next question and []
U1: those who would happen question number []
U1: 11 is for 64,000 pounds let's have a []
U1: look at it []
U1: what was the name of George Washington's []
U1: wife Abigail []
U1: Martha Letitia Elizabeth I don't know []
U1: I'm guessing do you know no I don't know []
U1: I'm tend to get some answers it will not []
U1: cause martyrs are go back kind of []
U1: down-home American yeah you know []
U1: oh that's maybe that's why it's there in []
U1: the mix market I mean we can never go []
U1: army abaca Abigail washes Martha []
U1: Washington Elizabeth Washington them []
U1: rings a logician any others have a ring []
U1: to George Washington and his wife []
U1: Abigail one part of George Washington []
U1: and his wife Letitia I cannot tell a lie []
U1: not only the kid yeah like this is a []
U1: hard one []
U1: oh well I'm going to go Abigale or []
U1: Martha so we should just make a final []
U1: decision between those two so to go []
U1: Martha I think we should go Martha but []
U1: it is it's a in here decimal guess yeah []
U1: it's just because I dissociate Martha []
U1: with a little house and a prayer in all []
U1: that kind of you know down-home American []
U1: tradition something's a good old []
U1: American plan to your name because we're []
U1: not gonna get any left over we got 32 []

U1: stuck on 32,000 pounds if you've said []
U1: Leticia []
U1: it'd still be stuck on 32,000 pounds if []
