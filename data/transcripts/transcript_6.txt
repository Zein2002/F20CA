U1: Shakespeare is right Shakespeare did you []
U1: do I do I just loads I because about 12 []
U1: can you quote honey yeah sonnet []
U1: that is the question one use the article []
U1: what is the answer I think that about []
U1: you the wrong solution right if we have []
U1: two thousand pounds question number four []
U1: is for five thousand pounds here it []
U1: comes the Pierce Brosnan film Dante's []
U1: Peak featured what kind of natural []

U1: peak how do those four things is a []
U1: mountain yeah []
U1: when I have you seen the film now I have []
U1: as I can remember the poster I'm just []
U1: trying to think of the poster and I'm []
U1: trying to think what was in the []
U1: background and it was either a kind of []
U1: volcano Mountain or a kind of tornado []
U1: shape that way although it was some []
U1: roughly triangular but I can't remember []
U1: which way it was up but if I can just []
U1: sit I think I think it was all kind of []
U1: corruption and we have to get a peak on []
U1: a rampage at a peak on a volcano []
U1: wouldn't you and Dante is Dante's []
U1: Inferno which is fire so it's got to be []
U1: a full kind of production no reckon you []
U1: don't actually know but we're going to []
U1: yeah I'd be happy to guess volcanic []
U1: eruption by the months yeah right a []
U1: thousand []
U1: you got diagram get three away from []
U1: 50,000 I'd be a great result []
U1: you've still little three left on it's []
U1: question number five you salute the []
U1: 1,000 closer number five is now for []
U1: 10,000 pounds here comes which chase I []
U1: you see anything with Shakespearean []
U1: character famously demands a pound of []
U1: flesh []
U1: Sherlock Lady Macbeth Yago Donner oh you []
U1: played him home you without nose come on []
U1: listen it's so long yeah tell us about []
U1: fun loves it is shallow you got 10 grand []
U1: 10,000 pounds very quickly because the []
U1: number six is 420 thousand pounds eww []
U1: money here or will warn it is a big old []
U1: drop you would lose 9,000 pounds if you []
U1: give me one us take it down have a look []
U1: this letter number six have a possible []
U1: 12 you're halfway key to get this right []
U1: here it comes []
U1: we're in Britain was the world's first []
U1: metal bridge built copper bridge Gorge []
U1: Ironbridge Gorge led bridge Gorge tin []
U1: bridge gorge well []
U1: well let's you couldn't build the bridge []
U1: out of place because you could have []
U1: heavy and soft and it would just []
U1: collapse []
U1: I mean Kabul was the first metal that []
U1: was mined in in England yes but you []
U1: couldn't build a productive ocarina []
U1: although it might look coffee they might []
U1: cut you nose and might cover it with []
U1: Picasa 10 would be sailing it might be []
U1: called for the bridge but behind bridge []
U1: you'd be pretty tough to build an iron []
U1: bridge in lead bridge bridge red bridge []
U1: College Cambridge Gorge Ironbridge Gorge []
U1: VI approaches why would it why would it []
U1: not be iron for exactly why would it not []
U1: why would it would it would it be copper []
U1: bridge but it might be built somewhere []
U1: that's that but mind other metals maybe []
U1: it's something like that I don't know []
U1: what do you think I think I think we've []
U1: been talking ourselves out of it []
U1: design blade which is move well I think []
U1: yet you think so yeah I'm bridge yes I []
U1: agree yeah hi I'm Bruce Emily if you []
U1: keep refined which bottle of yeah throw []
U1: it out so you turn it down []
U1: listen you got 20 grand you I've got []
U1: three lifelines to get you up to 50,000 []
U1: pounds that from next serious milestone []
U1: and you would be guaranteed to go home []
U1: with at least that amount of which right []
U1: pickles the next question this is for []
U1: 50,000 pounds have a look the statue []
U1: known as winged victory depicts which []
U1: Greek goddess on that slightly Athena []
U1: Nike Aphrodite Athena seen []
U1: I think it's our science I think the []
U1: winged victory is the statute just at []
U1: the bottom of Hyde Park next to []
U1: Buckingham Palace the one the one the []
U1: one with the you know []
U1: so we'll you know the one so why []
U1: wouldn't you know I'm doing Victoria one []
U1: you know the one with us with the []
U1: chariot and the horses just at the []
U1: bottom of Hyde Park you know I think []
U1: that that I think that's winged victory []
U1: what am I thinking he's Athena who who []
U1: was it supposed it's approached she's []
U1: the puppet observer gotta propose closer []
U1: no Athena I don't know what she did I []
U1: don't know what she did except she was []
U1: Greek goddess and she had wings but I []
U1: wouldn't I mean I would say I was []
U1: probably about 60 or 70 percent right []
U1: what do you think you think it's Nike []
U1: don't you well I don't really have a []
U1: clue to be honest I don't think it's []
U1: Aphrodite the goddess of love and you []
U1: know and it she wind victories is a []
U1: woman on a horse with with how do we []
U1: know but yet it's probably Athena the []
U1: only thing I'm saying is thinking about []
U1: Nike is yeah if you ran a company they []
U1: made athletic gear yeah sure []
U1: the goddess of we need to between []
U1: literary sounds like your woman but I []
U1: don't even have Nikes a man or a woman []
U1: so that's the only thing I would say an []
U1: icy nicey in a we're discounting psyche []
U1: and Aphrodite yeah []
U1: psyche is obviously selected moaning but []
U1: we decide you the goddess and whinging []
U1: and basically don't definitely know []
U1: though do we []
U1: I've said was that 60s potential which []
U1: is not enough today and I bi don't know []
U1: who I can't lure no no sir I bet you do []
U1: though don't you see either 50 on this []
U1: do you think but then what if it's []
U1: Athena in psyche we doesn't really go []
U1: proceed what is the theme of precisely []
U1: then we'll go Christine definitely is []
U1: that agreed at all you know and []
U1: Aphrodite yeah yeah we will say yes []
U1: we'll go for a female okay is that what []
U1: we're saying I think we'll see you see []
U1: what they do with the 50s because we're []
U1: losing a lot we do that are we []
U1: definitely sure it's not a photo let's []
U1: see what the statistical level no but I []
U1: think we should make decision now []
U1: really yeah nice plan ahead yeah because []
U1: if we're not actually sure then we []
U1: should say let's not risk it and go 5050 []
U1: because anything have to get again then []
U1: that's too risky I think we should []
U1: decide []
U1: we are the audience what you just meant []
U1: 50 on Athena and Aphrodite are we []
U1: definitely going to go for Cena yes []
U1: you're happy to do that I'm happy to do []
U1: that []
U1: all right let me that's going in from []
U1: let's go 5050 and see what they say []
U1: shall we then if we choose them on our []
U1: own lecture then I don't have speck []
U1: inside okay well we know I only think []
U1: it's Nike because it's the winget []
U1: victory of the sports that the tick is []
U1: there like a wing at 6:00 []
U1: there's nothing like a wing wing' 61 []
U1: singing victory the wound []
U1: Nike winged victory see what it's an []
U1: Athena Nike what we're going to do then []
U1: donor phone will cry though crystal []
U1: system and well we just keep going []
U1: within the 50/50 is just exactly where []
U1: you were before notification sweetie in []
U1: making nineteen psyche of Nike anything []
U1: like that makes excited on EastEnders []
U1: domain like you might be okay if you []

U1: north coast and further away Algeria is []
U1: massive []
U1: but I think it's genius here the weather []
U1: I'm sure about that I know when you if []
