U1: alright here we have the journalist and []
U1: writer Piers Morgan and his friendly []
U1: conservative MP and author and Widom []
U1: Pierre started his meteoric rise in []
U1: newspapers as showbiz editor of a son []
U1: back in the late 1980s and somehow []
U1: managed to be pictured in the paper on a []
U1: daily basis plays like every celebrity []
U1: of the age from there he was appointed []
U1: editor of the news of the world at the []
U1: tender age of 28 becoming fleet Street's []
U1: youngest editor for fifty years two []
U1: years later he was editing the mirror []
U1: but then left suddenly to carve out a []
U1: career in broadcastin most notably []
U1: alongside Amanda Patel in the Channel 4 []
U1: show Morgan and littell however is []
U1: probably best known his blockbuster []
U1: autobiography he asked me to emphasize []
U1: that the insider that on the fact that []
U1: he's been stumped by Jeremy Clarkson the []
U1: face unlikely to befall his friend and []
U1: Widdecombe and who admits to []
U1: occasionally texting this show from home []
U1: is one of the most colorful characters []
U1: in politics and after spelling marketing []
U1: and administration was elected as Member []
U1: of Parliament for Maidstone in 1987 []
U1: since then she's been both shadow home []
U1: secretary and shadow Secretary of State []

U1: piece on the mirror when I was still an []
U1: editor and having a gainful employment []
U1: we reran a big campaign to get them a []
U1: pay rise that was I thought commensurate []
U1: with what they did with all the public []
U1: services obviously a very worthwhile but []
U1: yeah a very few jobs in the world where []
U1: you go into a burning building and []
U1: you're not quite sure you'll come out []
U1: alive so I think for that reason the []
U1: fireman to me have always been pretty []
U1: exceptional people the firefighters []
U1: because I see women as those men and and []
U1: why why particularly the Holyland []
U1: the donkeys out there I get an extremely []
U1: poor deal they're not treated as beasts []
U1: at all they're treated as chap []
U1: and when they're no longer any use that []
U1: is discarded by the wayside and there's []
U1: been some very good stories for example []

U1: means of getting the donkey to the []
U1: shelter who did they ask for help and []

U1: sleeve and appears right answer and one []
U1: remaining wrong it's protected and he's []
U1: off delete something []
U1: I'll tell me as you see how you've done []
U1: that for a typical politician Jeff []
U1: sidewindin I went great final answer []
U1: final uncle absolutely right you got []
U1: 16,000 []
U1: right serious business then you are one []
U1: away from 32,000 pounds I'd be delighted []
U1: to write you a check on the spot for []
U1: that amount of money but we Danner to []
U1: play this you can walk over 16,000 if []
U1: you gave me a wrong answer here you []
U1: would lose 15,000 pounds okay question []
U1: number 10 would guarantee your 32,000 []
U1: pounds if you went for it and gave you []
U1: the right answer it's this question []
U1: which novel begins Christmas won't be []
U1: Christmas without any presence the []
U1: railway children Little Women Uncle []
U1: Tom's Cabin little Lord Fontenoy it's []
U1: the novel begins first with emphasis was []
U1: when the novel began with the railway []
U1: children they were quite well off though []
U1: I don't think they would have been []
U1: contemplating the Christmas with no []
U1: presents if you remember that father was []
U1: then taken away Little Women same again []
U1: they started off all together but I do []
U1: not know Uncle Tom's Cabin nor do i I []
U1: just don't never you think these three []
U1: are all pretty well off started I know []
U1: that the railway children were and that []
U1: little woman they were all together when []
U1: they started little Lord Fauntleroy must []
U1: have been []
U1: the argument was over who was formed to []
U1: us I hope it might have just might have []
U1: just originated in poverty but like I []
U1: wish I remembered Uncle Tom's Cabin []
U1: and I vent you can definitely reckon you []
U1: Kleman a trial which was a little []
U1: unlikely certainly eliminate the railway []
U1: children I'm very confident in doing []
U1: that and I've probably turned out to be []
U1: the answer I think I can eliminate []
U1: little women but if we do that we go []
U1: from 16,000 to 1,000 well I don't think []
U1: we should risk it if it was just me I'd []
U1: gamble all that yeah it was me I'd have []
U1: done Africa room 10 but he didn't it's []
U1: challenging I don't know I don't know []
U1: the answer final answer is that we do []
U1: not leave we don't and we're going to []
U1: save that money to charity helping I []
U1: think we we stick with what we've got []
U1: the Arctic's mm this could be the first []
U1: time they get to be contrite my life []
U1: take the money okay give a big hand []
U1: which one would you come on which ones []
U1: you gone for I think in the end I would []
U1: have probably done on the basis of a []
U1: most uncertain elimination Uncle Tom's []
U1: Cabin argue I go run away children this []
U1: is gonna be so funny if you were wrong []
U1: well okay okay tell me it with Little []
U1: Women []
U1: it was Little Women well we made the []
U1: right decision we made the right []
U1: decision and did say if we got two []
U1: million she kissed me and I'm not quite []
U1: ready for that unnecessarily you say []
U1: that now []
U1: cleverest double accent even fry and []
U1: Hugh Laurie are back on our screens can []
U1: I say eight on challenge it's the quanti []
U1: always joking it's Alexander Armstrong []
U1: and Richard Osmond is more pointless []
