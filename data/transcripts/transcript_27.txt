U1: foundation of charity she herself set up []
U1: the memory of her daughter Karen who []
U1: died of breast cancer in 2004 Gloria []
U1: darling I know it's been a really tough []
U1: time for you and the family has the []
U1: public response to this help strengthen []
U1: you just enormously it does and you know []
U1: the letters that I actually get great []
U1: comfort from are from people who have []
U1: lost children themselves because I've []
U1: lost my parents former husband friends []
U1: colleagues but actually although they []
U1: were deeply deeply sorrowful but it's []
U1: not even on the Richter scale compared []
U1: to losing a child and so therefore you []
U1: know when parents writings say a []
U1: particularly mother writes and says I []
U1: know how you feel because I lost my []
U1: child 22 years ago or whatever it is []
U1: those levels are being hugely thanks or []
U1: useful apart from of course just the []
U1: wave of love towards Karen I mean that []
U1: also helps you of course and it's not []
U1: just the the foundation is not purely []
U1: for breast cancer []
U1: or absolutely not and we have a very []
U1: clear idea for what we want to do and []
U1: what we are doing and we we feed all []
U1: sorts of cancer charities and we do what []
U1: I loosely call drip feeding because we []
U1: don't do massive payouts although we []
U1: have raised by a lot of money but we do []
U1: know 5,000 here 10,000 there 12,000 []
U1: sometimes 2,000 but where it really []
U1: makes a difference so that's why it's []
U1: wonderful to come on a show like this []

U1: project but that will help hopefully we []
U1: can raise lots of money between you []
U1: Frederick the Society of stars what's []
U1: the real major focus of their work where []

U1: children with cerebral palsy so it's an []
U1: unglamorous if you like and sometimes []
U1: disregarded affliction videos and []
U1: appalling disability strikes children at []
U1: birth and they never really bother []
