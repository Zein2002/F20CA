U1: Hey []
U1: hello welcome to another very special []
U1: charity edition of Who Wants to Be a []
U1: Millionaire where and unusual line-up of []
U1: some of our best known faces leave their []
U1: egos back in their dressing rooms to []
U1: take on the merciless computer in the []
U1: hope of raising large sums of money for []
U1: their favorite causes back in the []
U1: scariest pair of seats in the land again []
U1: this week at Charles Kennedy and Jane []
U1: Moore as we told you last time Charles []
U1: was born and educated fairly obviously []
U1: in Scotland he started his working life []
U1: as a broadcaster and journalist for the []
U1: BBC in Inverness but was lured into the []
U1: world of politics by the SDP during the []
U1: general election of 1983 within six []
U1: weeks he became the youngest MP in the []
U1: House by snatching the seat for Ross []
U1: chromatin and sky from a Tory Minister []
U1: bit of a coup by 1999 Charles was the []
U1: leader of the merged Liberal Democrats []
U1: and took the part is their greatest []
U1: election result for 80 years []
U1: in 2005 still very active and vocal []
U1: figure in the party he's currently MP []
U1: for Ross Skye and Lochaber []
U1: Jane Moore is an author and journalist []
U1: she started out doing a Saturday job for []
U1: the Sunday people now she is the longest []
U1: running columnist for the Sun in the []
U1: past five years she has published five []
U1: successful novels and somewhere along []
U1: the way she's found time to carve out a []
U1: career as a television broadcaster []
U1: making food documentaries and appearing []
U1: on loose women it's morning and even as []
U1: a somewhat unlikely grumpy old woman []
U1: looks about unlikely ask me to get a []
U1: charger generator with as much as they []
U1: can for the fire services national []
U1: benevolent fund now why that share it to []
U1: you guys why particularly um I've got a []
U1: bit of a thing about firemen well you []
U1: have I think those good men do don't []
U1: they but it's just it's one of those []
U1: charters it does fantastic work and even []
U1: if you think about various disasters []
U1: over the years I mean particularly 9/11 []
U1: I think the iconic image was one when []
U1: everyone was running out of the building []
U1: the firemen were going in and of course []
U1: that was a worldwide scale image but if []
U1: you think that happens every single day []
U1: all over the country that you know when []
U1: families are escaping firemen are going []
U1: in to rescue people and of course []
U1: statistics are coming down for injuries []
U1: but they do get injured and the other []
U1: massive factor is that they get very []
U1: psychologically traumatized because []
U1: particularly if you've had to rescue []
U1: children who've suffered burns or you've []
U1: had to go to a road traffic accident []
U1: particularly involving children again so []
U1: if the fund raises money to centers and []
U1: they can go there firemen and have []
U1: therapy either for physical wounds or []
U1: also for psychological ones and the []
U1: center's also help to treat children []
U1: who've suffered some burns as well you []
U1: know the long-term psychological effect []
U1: apart from the immediate one you had a []
U1: senior horrible scene like that can be []
U1: very very profound and you know it's not []
U1: just the individual firefighter is Jean []
U1: was seeing the way their family and []
U1: indeed their families quite separate []
U1: from what the firefighter him or herself []
U1: may have done their career but as they []
U1: encounter older age they've got []
U1: difficulties these centers are there as []
U1: a source of support as well when I come []

U1: wouldn't be Norman Wisdom []
U1: it's got Eric Sykes written all over it []
U1: for me but I'll call Ronnie Corbett one []
U1: of those two yeah []

U1: just automate you feel good really right []
U1: there are no thousand it's for sixteen []
U1: thousand pounds for the next voice you []
U1: hear will be the shrill piping voice of []

U1: are still four possible answers one of []
U1: these is below 16,000 or of it okay Joey []
U1: don't take your time Zeus exercise now I []
U1: ran into a circle mythology psyche is []
U1: the personification of what a rainbow []
U1: the love the sky the soul God I'm not []
U1: sure Jane I'd guess it soul but that's []
U1: only a guess what's your what do you []
U1: think yeah no we're thinking that as []
U1: well well I can only guess as well of []
U1: you I'm sorry not to be better on that I []
U1: gave your soul okay thanks Russ []
U1: right moment of truth []
U1: ma'am lowlife lovers certain things the []
U1: same as ours back to one context context []
U1: right hang on it there's a key not []
U1: rainbow it can't be rainbows no well []
U1: reborn skywriting one category in love []
U1: and saw another psyche psyche but mind []
U1: and soul is that love ever get you can []
U1: walk away with a transplants you denied []
U1: to play this question yeah but we don't []
U1: ignore them []
U1: we don't know but []
U1: Saiki he told us and recycle over that []
U1: derive more than I might say I don't []
U1: know well I just took my psyche psyche []
U1: your psyche well we keep doing that talk []
U1: about it no why do we do that and then []
U1: you can't you go like that and that []
U1: could mean sky could mean you've just []
U1: done a rainbow shape of coffee wrong []
U1: could be any of them well it will be []
U1: Haitian and will be one of them yes we []
U1: were 25% chance so do we gamble all when []
U1: I 1 and 4 or do we stick 8 which is []
U1: closable enough 8,000 is 8 firemen []
U1: rehabilitated Hutus eight injured []
U1: firemen rehabilitated I'm a massive risk []
U1: taker but I'm bearing towards the Kings []
U1: what do you think I'm a very cautious []
U1: person I'm airing and favorable taking a []
U1: massive risk you know what act but I'm []
U1: not securing what's is a risk for me []
U1: because you well between us we've given []
U1: semi convincing arguments for all any []
U1: one of the four of us so that we can []
U1: feel before []
U1: I think you're right I think so it's []
U1: there to sell I thought you will see us []
U1: how are we going to feel when it's set []
U1: when soul comes up green got it I'm []
U1: gonna feel that we play and we're wrong []

U1: good mask at me yeah you're cool you're []
U1: totally in control the computing do []
U1: whatever you want panting a stick stick []
U1: talk yet six final answer orchard enough []
U1: by the lads gather that if you've been []
U1: playing for your own vast millions yeah []
U1: from tabloids organism I guess had we []
U1: been given our own devices rather than []
U1: other people's charitable interests yeah []
