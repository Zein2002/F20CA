U1: hour in this country so it's you know []
U1: there's a lot []
U1: a lot of uh it's a lot of work to be []
U1: done out there now i do think lot of a []
U1: lot of people actually don't realize how []
U1: how dangerous you know []
U1: the work is for fun no well i think they []
U1: think that uh that a lot of it is to do []
U1: with you know cats up trees but um and []
U1: there's probably an element of that but []
U1: the fact is []
U1: they've kind of got to go and put fires []
U1: out as well and when that happens []
U1: there's there's they'll put their lives []
U1: on the line okay []
U1: said tim and jeremy are on question []

U1: they can phone a friend good luck tim []
U1: and jeremy let's play who wants to be a []
U1: millionaire []
U1: so this is for fifty thousand pounds []
U1: guaranteed if you give me the right []
U1: answer that would be the minimum amount []
U1: you would leave here with tonight []
U1: question number seven is this []
U1: what was the middle name of the us []
U1: president dwight d eisenhower []
U1: dennis []
U1: david []
U1: donald []
U1: damien []
U1: surprisingly because i don't know []
U1: anything about politics i think i have []
U1: an idea what the answer is fantastic []
U1: because i don't []
U1: oh i thought perhaps oh really do you []
U1: not well they go on go on i thought []
U1: perhaps it was donald and i thought that []
U1: was partly to do with um []
U1: donald donald duck []
U1: something to do with donald duck []
U1: i was really going with the answer until []
U1: until the duck came into it []
U1: why would they have named the future []
U1: president after donald duck no no it was []
U1: the other way around []
U1: they named the da ha after uh []
U1: like []
U1: donald eisenhower although they might []
U1: just call donald duck []
U1: just because it was also began with d so []
U1: i could be wrong about that []
U1: all right []
U1: we know it's not damien no damien was []
U1: the little boy in the omen []
U1: he was not a u.s president []
U1: that's right []
U1: what about i don't think it's dennis it []
U1: doesn't sound right does it dwight []
U1: dennis eisenhower i just think []
U1: dennis wasn't around in the u.s at that []
U1: time as a name []
U1: i could have been david but why would []
U1: they ask i mean it just it's such a []
U1: boring name that isn't it yeah if you've []
U1: started with dwight why go to david []
U1: i could imagine the other way around []
U1: exactly you could say david dwight the []
U1: middle name that's the word well he []
U1: might have wanted to give him options []
U1: yeah it would be so good to get this []
U1: without phoning our friend did you have []
U1: any inkling before i went off on my []
U1: donald duck thing no i just and i was []
U1: funny i really wanted a political []
U1: question but not this one []
U1: eisenhower []
U1: all we know is that he was known as ike []
U1: and he was president at the end of the []
U1: second world war that doesn't really []
U1: help very much []
U1: um []
U1: why why why donald let's go we're there []
U1: on the day of his birth he's being born []
U1: his mum and dad say it's got to be []
U1: dwight we love that name it's got to be []
U1: eisenhower that's his surname the middle []
U1: name and suddenly he shouts it out what []
U1: did he shout []
U1: he says i know what it is it's david oh []
U1: no []
U1: no i don't think you'd say david i think []
U1: i think well i somewhere i feel like []
U1: i've read that but i don't want to be oh []
U1: gosh i don't want to be the one right []
U1: okay []
U1: yeah []
U1: listen that's as good as we've got []
U1: i feel if we use our phone a friend on []
U1: this we are but then we have to get this []
U1: one right []
U1: yeah []
U1: it can't be dennis you're wrong you lose []
U1: 19 000. well i can just just uh unpack []
U1: that why can't it be dennis i just think []
U1: dennis is a silly name []
U1: it's not a presidential name []
U1: whereas dwight just you know this []
U1: should we phone our friend he will know []
U1: but then he'll know he'll know other []
U1: things as well []
U1: dwight donald eisenhower i think yeah []
U1: let's do it that's your way let's do it []
U1: let's do it let's just do it look if []
U1: it's wrong i []
U1: will be pursued by far engines for the []
U1: rest of our lives []
U1: um but i think i think strategically []
U1: here hang on just another question []
U1: though []
U1: we drop down to one ground if we're []
U1: wrong you drop down one the biggest nice []
U1: thing that can happen on this program is []
U1: this moment yeah []
U1: it's worth fifty thousand why did you []
U1: can't find a friend yeah donald duck i []
U1: don't know why i thought that was donald []
U1: duck with something to do with that why []
U1: we like donald []
U1: trump []
U1: do we like stay with []
U1: is because the name donald because of []
U1: donald duck like tim is saying was []
U1: clearly currency in the states at that []
U1: time you know donald was a popular name []
U1: because there was a duck called right []
U1: so []
U1: i know that's it's not even a straw it's []
U1: part of a straw that we're clutching out []
U1: should we just do it and then if it's []
U1: wrong []
U1: you know try to look like it was a []
U1: really brave decision []
U1: the other option []
U1: the other option of course is that we []
U1: ring the phone a friend []
U1: and we find out for sure and okay we've []
U1: used up all our lifelines or maybe we []
U1: don't find it for sure maybe he doesn't []
U1: know we use up all our lifelines and uh []
U1: we go for donald donald's right we find []
U1: ourselves []
U1: um at least we've got that 50 grand but []
U1: what do you say listen you're the older []
U1: brother you've got to make the choice at []
U1: this point what we do i've got an []
U1: inkling of donald that's all i can say []
U1: i'm going to go back to my cabin now []

U1: yeah 20 000 pounds []
U1: you just lost 19 000 pounds tim and []
U1: jeremy what do you like we had to save []
U1: him we had to save him the right answer []
U1: is dwight david eisenhower i must call []
U1: him and find out if he if he knew []
U1: i hope he didn't []
U1: but thanks well i've got to take some []
U1: responsibility for that i suppose []
U1: because it was nothing whatsoever to do []
U1: with donald duck was it []
