U1: going on with absolutely nothing but []
U1: more hopefully doing rather better than []
U1: that and raising serious money for their []

U1: friends tonight []
U1: Melinda first works as an air stewardess []
U1: and an office manager so we're going to []
U1: imagine actually but came to the []
U1: forefront when her warfront great a sexy []
U1: poster campaign for companies selling []
U1: windows stop touching her she was []
U1: quickly snapped up at a mother and a []
U1: pastry girl and even achieved that []

U1: night in recently she has visited Malawi []
U1: working tirelessly for Action Aid and []
U1: this is in fact action aid that will []
U1: benefit from half of any winnings the []
U1: pair of them achieved tonight and the []
U1: other half of Gator Alistair's chosen []
U1: charity scope I mean it's fantastic []
U1: tarragon I've been involved in here's []
U1: why that one there's so many to choose []
U1: from now it is very difficult indeed []
U1: and and partly it's the cause clearly it []
U1: used to be no specific society and []
U1: unfortunately some kids still use that []
U1: language and I get very cross if they do []
U1: for me it's about human rights it's []
U1: about equality people who have kids []
U1: they're blessed they're very very lucky []
U1: and God willing they're healthy []
U1: occasionally they'll have a child with []
U1: cerebral palsy and even some people are []
U1: medical professionals so you know that's []
U1: not really all there so maybe try better []
U1: luck next time on what have you and what []
U1: we try to do say that's not necessary []
U1: everybody has the same right the parents []
U1: have the rights the child most []
U1: importantly has the rights we work in []
U1: education we work in politics equality []
U1: camp []
U1: and we want disable ISM to be something []
U1: like racism and sexes and it's just not []
U1: on and that's what escapes all about []
U1: fantastic I said well I always think []
U1: that for the other members of the family []
U1: must be so tough yeah because you almost []
U1: can't win you know you've got one one []
U1: child who has a an obvious problem yeah []
U1: for the parents bringing them up looking []
U1: like well if it loses there's there's a []
U1: school and college near where we live []
U1: down in Hampshire called log Metro law []
U1: and we do work with them and they're []
U1: very close to escape as well and one of []
U1: the greatest single joys is to see the []
U1: brothers and sisters mums and dads here []
U1: and that is a love that you cannot []
U1: measure you need very very real and very []
U1: very deep Malinda malawi yes well i went []
U1: there recently and really to see the []
U1: kind of what the action they do is I []
U1: mean they work around the world to []
U1: support children who are living in []
U1: poverty and around the globally there's []
U1: something like twelve million orphans []
U1: and that's more than the number of []
U1: children in the UK and they're living in []
U1: such extreme circumstances they've been []
U1: offered primarily due to AIDS because []
U1: it's obviously just semuc proportions []
U1: out there and but actually a fantastic []
U1: because they will they will work with []
U1: the people who are in the country so []
U1: they will give the kind of aid that is []
U1: needed and it's long-term care so for []
U1: example they'll set up daycare centres []
U1: for children who were living on the []
U1: streets and they'll give them an []
U1: education they'll give them a meal []
U1: looking a home and a future which they []
U1: wouldn't have without them and they'll []
U1: also support families where they've lost []
U1: parents and breadwinners and if there []
U1: are older children and older sisters []
U1: they'll give them a life skill training []
U1: so I mean I met one lad who was being []
U1: trained to be a carpenter and that meant []
U1: then he could support his family and the []
U1: great thing about Action Aid is that []
U1: they are they are supporting the people []
U1: who live there and know exactly what the []
U1: problem is and a little bit of money []
U1: goes an awful long way out there []
U1: see the thing I I think is that most []
U1: people in Britain and America and Europe []
U1: for aids or something dreadful that sort []
U1: of happened in the 80s and 90s whatever []
U1: think I was it's alright now it's okay []
U1: now you know and I don't think it's part []
U1: of the work people at Bob Geldof Bono []
U1: I mean Annie Lennox is a most fantastic []
U1: look on it I don't think most people in []
U1: this country actually realize how []
U1: epidemic aids still is in Africa and []
U1: it's terrifying that favors of almond []
U1: AIDS yeah absolutely and burns Reuters []
U1: report and parents are dying isn't it []
U1: something like 15% of the population out []
U1: there have AIDS and this situation could []
U1: be helped and alleviated through []
U1: education but also by giving them the []
U1: right drugs and and that there is a []
U1: pledge that there will be age treatment []
U1: for all by the year 2010 and there is a []
U1: shortfall at the moment that's not being []
U1: met so you know we're hoping that all []
U1: the governments will get behind that []
U1: promise that was made at the g8 and []
U1: deliver that but in the meantime it is []
U1: organizations like Action Aid who are []
U1: out there doing the work and trying to []
U1: keep these people alive although we can []
U1: make lots of money time my other really []
U1: major question to you is where's your []
U1: blonde hair gone something I don't move []
U1: the place and walk straight past and []
U1: apparently her kids walk past me they []
U1: did my six-year-old with money but I []

U1: doing that's what I do for a living []
U1: this we don't know exactly what we're []

U1: against which invaders of England's []
U1: Normans Spanish Vikings Romans Alistair []
U1: you probably covered this on the news []
U1: he said he cooked cake burners after the []
U1: Great Scott against which invaders of []
U1: England Normans Spanish Vikings Romans []
U1: I'm not going to say anything yet []
U1: because I am oh I haven't got a hunch I []
U1: don't know but I would hazard a guess []
U1: but that wouldn't be good enough []
U1: and multiple in my guess would be either []
U1: the Spanish or the Vikings okay I think []
U1: it's the Vikings but given that I think []
U1: do you think that's worth a new friend []
U1: yeah dude or ask the audience or []
U1: fifty-fifty but my I'm Spanish were []
U1: Vikings for me if you think Mike is the []
U1: odds obligation banished Hamza I think []
U1: we'd I think we did the Spanish in the []
U1: 15th century sort of Elizabeth the first []
U1: kind of time Romans I think was I think []
U1: the Romans was was a little earlier than []
U1: Alfred the gave of the Normans were []
U1: certainly later collapsed 1066 I think []
U1: it is the Vikings but I think Alex would []
U1: know []
U1: so we don't I think we should go for it []
U1: rather because I do it then that's our []
U1: phony friend gone it is and you have an []
U1: inkling of Vikings and I had an inkling []
U1: yeah I'm just afraid in case and it's []
U1: 2:00 to 4:00 or drop down to one yet I []
U1: think we should I think we should you []
U1: got another and it's worth for us it's []
