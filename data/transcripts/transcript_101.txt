S: Welcome to a charity special Who Wants to Be a Millionaire 

S: It's a tough life for celebrities these days you've either got to face snakes spiders and unspeakable marsupial body parts in the Australian jungle risk breaking your neck on the ice rink or worse still worst of all have to sit opposite me but our celebrities on the show do put a brave face on it knowing there is a real chance of making a million pounds for their favourite cause

S: Now coming up later on this show we got Maxand Paddy, A-List comedians Peter Kay and Patrick McGuinness but first now will you welcome our first two famous and possibly largest ever fortune seekers England rugby heroes Martin Johnson that Will Greenwood.

S: I thought for a second there had been an eclipse but it was just these two coming in
Back tonight for the professional rugby players Benevolent Fund is Midland born Martin Johnson who is a rugby giant in every sense of the word

S: In fact he is regarded as one of the greatest rugby forwards of all timeMartin of course famously broke every Australians' heart by captaining England to magnificent Rugby World Cup victory. Yes! in 2003. I remember how sorry w for the Australians we all felt.

S: Martin quit while he was on top and retired from international rugby a few months later although he did continue to play for Leicester right up to 2005 and nowadays splits his time between motivational speaking and running his Martin Johnson rugby camp where boys and girls can go to develop their playing skills and their instinct to win.

S: Sitting next to him looking at him oddly and here to raise money for the child bereavement charity his Will Greenwood who hails from Blackburn in Lancashire. 
S: Will was also by Martin side during that epic glorious 2003 World Cup victory being two years younger but a lot smaller than his captain, Will continue to play an  international level for a little longer he was selected for the British and Irish Lions tour of New Zealand in 2005 he too retired from the game completely in 2006 with 55 England caps and 31 tries to his name he now brings his experience and personality to bear as an after-dinner speaker and a much sought after rugby pundit on TV 
S: Welcome guys. Martin why this particular charity I mean obviously because your involvement in rugby what what do you do for these guys?
U1: Well I think particularly with the the PRA benevolent fund there's a guy called Matt Hanson at Leicester who unfortunately injured got badly injured in their training excercise and a couple of years ago and is now paralyzed so we do a lot of the club at Leicesster to help Matt, he needs constant care and 
S: So it's mainly that sort of thing because I think oh come on rugby players after it's finished they can carry on working

U1: and Yeah they can 

U1: The guys are gonna injured and also just helping guys start a career once they finish rugby because then as you say they're in a position where they have to carry on working it's not where they can retire at age 32 [] 
U1: Whatever and they've got they've got to keep on going so it's a good charity

S: Will the child bereavement charity; there's a particular reason why you're involved with it isn't it? []

U2: Yeah very much so we we lost our little boy Freddie on September the 19th 2002 and the child bereavement charity were there for us immediately []
U2: They help grieving families they help families who lose a child or even lose a parent, come to come to terms of that process and those first few hours, those first few weeks are very very important and we we owe them a lot in that short space of time but they also help to to train professionals so the nurses the doctors the policemen who are on hand when these tragic accidents take place and it's it's all very important to help these families in those early early weeks in the early hours 

S: Okay Now Martin and Will are just 12 questions away from scoring a possible 1 million pounds for their two charities and if any of those questions  should prove a little bit tricky to tackle Haha they of course have their lifelines to convert them a 5050, phone-a-friend, and as always asked the audience
