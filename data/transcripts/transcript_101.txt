U1: to come to terms of that process and []
U1: there was first few hours as first few []
U1: weeks are very very important and we we []
U1: are them a lot in that short space of []
U1: time but they also help to to train []
U1: professionals so the nurses the doctors []
U1: the policemen who are on hand when these []
U1: tragic accidents take place and it's []
U1: it's all very important to help these []
U1: families in those early early weeks in []
U1: the early hours okay now Martin and Will []
U1: are just 12 questions away from scoring []
U1: a possible 1 million pounds for their to []
U1: charities and if any of those questions []
U1: should prove a little bit tricky to []
U1: tackle Oh have their lifelines to []
U1: convert them 5050 phone-a-friend []
U1: and has always asked the audience right []
U1: Martin will lots of luck let's play Who []
U1: Wants to Be a Millionaire []
U1: so question number one is for 500 pounds []
U1: here we go []
U1: what is the specific name for a painting []
U1: which is a likeness of a person usually []
U1: showing their piece Hostel fresco []
U1: portrait mural I would hazard a guess []
U1: that would see portrait very nice final []
U1: answer []
U1: Yeah right answer you have five on the []
U1: pan []
U1: got the number to guarantee 1000 pounds []
U1: it is the last point at which you could []
U1: go home with nothing you have all three []
U1: lifelines I'm sure will tell it's a word []
U1: I'm sure it won't happen []
U1: we're ship number two will guarantee a []
U1: thousand pound to again which king of []
U1: England was defeated at the Battle of []
U1: Hastings Ethelred Herald Alfred Edwards []
U1: Harold Harold it's the right up so you []
U1: have one thousand pounds []
U1: see he better now do you still sometimes []
U1: look back on the World Cup and think I []
U1: sort of see that Jonny Wilkinson goal []
U1: and think is it gonna go over sure I []
U1: would []
U1: I was at the bomber room couldn't see a []
U1: thing []
U1: I don't think you think about it like []
U1: that I think sometimes you forget you []
U1: just go Christ you everyone who won the []
U1: World Cup []
U1: when you yeah the tournament's just []
U1: happened again this time yeah sort of []
U1: even brings it home too when you watch []
U1: it I think because when you when you're []
U1: doing it you have a different []
U1: perspective like you have different []
U1: perspective means that here too watching []
U1: it on the TV or watching in everybody's []
U1: image Martin is that great shot of []
U1: Johnson just going no I think it's again []
U1: strange because people say what was it []
U1: like to lift the trophy in it wasn't a []
U1: big ego trip for me just being there and []
U1: doing the whole thing for us the []
U1: experience is not just the final or even []
U1: the tournament for us the experience is []
U1: years of building up disappointments []
U1: successes all those memories not for me []
U1: actually picking the World Cup I think []
U1: it's far more of a memory for people []
U1: watching than is that when they blind []
U1: write this is for 2,000 pounds you have []
