U1: lifelines of this member untouched []
U1: Anna why that particular charity - []
U1: you're killed Children's Foundation []

U1: it and funny enough last week only they []
U1: had a big ball and I gave them my hat []
U1: signed from the jungle and it raised []
U1: 14,000 pounds which was recently []
U1: fantastic so I'm this hope we could []
U1: you have well both of you but []
U1: particularly because you've done so many []
U1: things over these do you think I'm a []
U1: celebrity change both your lives well []
U1: undoubtedly with that question I mean I []
U1: think one of the reasons I went in []
U1: because the boys have asked me over the []
U1: years to go and I've always been []
U1: committed to doing pantomime and this []
U1: year they asked me in April so I was []
U1: able to say yes and I felt you know I've []
U1: been going years everyone's known me but []
U1: I've sort of been on a level and I []
U1: thought seriously that this could be []
U1: something that could give me another []
U1: chance and I always felt that if I could []
U1: get to the fourth position with David []
U1: gest got to last year it would be great []
U1: and of course to getting to be king of []
U1: the jungle was unbelievable everybody []
U1: was genuinely delightful yeah I know []
U1: what was the worst bit so many what was []
U1: the worst jumping out of the helicopter []
U1: I don't think I'll ever get over that []
U1: and you know I wanted to so much land []
U1: and go oh that was great let's do it []
U1: again but I will never ever do that []
U1: again also sleeping with the rats even []
U1: though I did have the king of the jungle []
U1: with me it was how many hours 12 14 hour []
U1: 14 hours we would do is dug down into []
U1: the ground and it was terrifying and []
U1: they they didn't give us much time []
U1: before they let in the 200 rats []
U1: I said to Anna look we don't have to do []
U1: this we really don't we can we can say []
U1: get us out of here quite easily but Anna []
U1: was very brave and then she was like []
U1: this though of the Alma hammock which is []
U1: one of those hammocks that really moved []
U1: all the way and I said now look we must []
U1: relax because we have to have some sleep []
U1: so I managed to get her to relax and []
U1: then everything happened from then on of []
