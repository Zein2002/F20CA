U1: richard yeah []
U1: it's the right answer you've got two []
U1: thousand pounds []
U1: i'm freaked out []
U1: very interesting there your theories and []
U1: probabilities about not using a lifeline []
U1: all []
U1: as you've said before chris this game is []
U1: you know it's if you know the questions []
U1: and if you don't know the questions []
U1: you've got to use show some nerve and []
U1: yes occasionally okay i guess you're []
U1: saying you thought you'd get the 32 000. []
U1: we'll see []
U1: well you've got six out of six and []
U1: you've still got the audience []
U1: yeah right question number seven then is []
U1: for four thousand pounds you're four []

U1: nine away from a million here it comes []
U1: have a look tell me what you wanna do []
U1: how many maids were a milking in the []

U1: go for spain yeah yeah yeah []
U1: yeah []
U1: would you say jack if you were wrong []
U1: i can't say it on tv []
U1: you're not wrong it's the right answer []
U1: you've got eight thousand pounds []
U1: it's a very emotional match for the []
U1: irish spain actually won three two []
U1: eventually on penalties now you have []
U1: eight thousand pounds question number []
U1: nine is for sixteen thousand pounds and []
U1: here it comes []
U1: where was mary queen of scots born []
U1: lynn lithgow []
U1: leipzig []
U1: leon []
U1: liege []
U1: my history is limited to be honest []
U1: so is mine um but um []
U1: still a lot of reading let's see got any []
U1: history professors on your []
U1: on your list []
U1: um no i don't i've got uh but i've got []
U1: um []
U1: one friend who's very good on []
U1: british history and the royal family and []
U1: all that sort of thing so []
U1: you might cut easily he might know this []
U1: who who's that []
U1: i don't know my name liam who's a banker []
U1: he's got a photographic memory he's []
U1: memorizing it's pretty much everything []
U1: he's ever read []
U1: i think i would have to go for liam []
U1: and um []
U1: hope he comes up with this don't you []
U1: mate liam okay []
U1: hello []
U1: liam []
U1: yeah hey good evening it's chris taran []
U1: here we're on who wants to be a []
U1: millionaire we have uh richard webber []
U1: and a young student called jack with him []
U1: oh my god oh my god they're doing rather []
U1: well actually uh they're on eight []
U1: thousand pounds but they are stuck at []
U1: this point richard says you're the man []
U1: to steer them through well let's hope so []
U1: okay richard okay 30 seconds your time []
U1: starts now []
U1: liam where was mary queen of scots born []
U1: lithgow leipzig leons or liege []
U1: okay can you repeat that where was mary []
U1: queen of scots born lin lithgow leipzig []
U1: lions or liege []
U1: okay it would absolutely not be liege or []
U1: lightstick i would say []
U1: let's go []
U1: um 75 sure []
U1: okay []
U1: thank you []
U1: and this is 75 sure []
U1: so much you're definitely in france []
U1: theory though i mean 75 is not 100 []
U1: no this is big cash for me []
U1: you got 8 000 at this moment []
U1: do you think play 50 50 it would okay []
U1: okay okay because if we if we just went []
U1: for lynette now on his 75 chance []
U1: i mean from a probabilistic point of []
U1: view that's a good bet we don't you know []
U1: we []
U1: yeah and then we then we've got a []
U1: lifeline []
U1: um []
U1: so let's play our 50 50. yeah and then []
U1: decide okay []
U1: yeah okay computer take away two wrong []
U1: answers leave richard and jack the right []
U1: answer and one remaining random wrong []
U1: answer []
U1: now []
U1: one of those is worth sixteen thousand []
U1: pounds youtube []
U1: one of them will cost you seven thousand []
U1: pounds []
U1: it is a lot of money to me []
U1: yeah but say he says 75 []
U1: and liam's going to be quite cautious []
U1: because he doesn't want to you know now []
U1: 75 percent of 16 000 is 12 000 right []
U1: um []
U1: so that's our x x our expectation []
U1: plus a little bit of a thousand []
U1: and then we you know that's what i was []
U1: thinking []
U1: if your theory is wrong will you give []
U1: him three and a half grand []
U1: maybe liam should []
U1: um yeah maybe liam should um liam where []
U1: is he need him []
U1: all right um []
U1: let's be mad about this let's go for a []
U1: we'll go for a []
U1: final answer []
U1: you lose seven thousand if you're wrong []
U1: guys one lancer jack []
U1: bye marta []
U1: you've just won sixteen thousand pounds []
U1: and a reminder once again they have this []
U1: is rather critical they have to agree on []
U1: their final answer on each question lots []
U1: of luck youtube chat richard let's play []
U1: who wants to be a millionaire []
U1: this is question number 10 of a possible []
U1: 15. here it comes []
U1: which of these []
U1: chemical elements is a halogen []
U1: argon []
U1: sulfur []
U1: nitrogen []
U1: fluorine []
U1: it's worth 32 000 pounds []
U1: you know much about chemistry []
U1: i know a little myself []
U1: so i'm visualizing the periodic table on []
U1: my mind right now trying to []
U1: replace those things it's definitely not []
U1: sulfur no []
U1: yeah it's not nitrogen []
U1: so it's either flooring or argon yeah []
U1: organs um []
U1: is that it's noble gas yeah yeah yeah i []
U1: would think so []
U1: um []
U1: i'm pretty sure that []
U1: yeah i'm just i just want to get it []
U1: straight my head to start with what []
U1: halogen do you know that all that is []
U1: not you know not a huge confidence no i []
U1: don't know what a halogen is um []
U1: can we think of any chemical words that []
U1: contain []
U1: fluorine and halogen together like []
U1: you know chloroflora high hygiene or []
U1: something or []
U1: not too many of the top of my head but []
U1: no um []
U1: this is something []
U1: to an extent or shouldn't they did you []
U1: study chemistry no it didn't but []
U1: um []
U1: okay it's not sulfur it's not nitrogen []
U1: okay []
U1: um []
U1: now dude what can you think of any other []
U1: halogens if you know if we knew other []
U1: halogens i mean i can sort of []
U1: visualize on this table they're they're []
U1: sort of over in the upper right part of []
U1: the periodic table i really don't mean []
U1: guessing at anything they do no i don't []
U1: want to be guessing i mean it's either []
U1: organofluorine um []
U1: but um []
U1: god []
U1: i mean if you if you were going to bed []
U1: if you were going to go for one which []
U1: would go []
U1: i don't know to be honest i []
U1: maybe i'd go with fluorine but []
U1: this is big money yeah no it is isn't it []
U1: i mean i'd also go with fluorine []
U1: to be honest i can't really i wouldn't []
U1: really want to just have a guess i []
U1: wouldn't want to i mean []
U1: okay we've got like a 50 50 chance right []
U1: okay []
U1: so []
U1: yeah and then a chance for free to guess []
U1: at 64 without losing so actually on a []
U1: purely statistical basis []
U1: we are going to have a higher []
U1: expectation of our ultimate reward by []
U1: guessing between the 50 50 choice okay []
U1: so []
U1: from that bureau argument []
U1: you know we should bet in []
U1: if we only cared about maximizing our []
U1: expected reward []
U1: but without such loss and drop into a []
U1: thousand particularly you know that i []
U1: think um []
U1: yeah i want forces to go that way []
U1: jack you look absolutely terrified i am []
U1: wow this is getting more scary um []
U1: what a shame []
U1: it's easier you know it's good []
U1: good on the pub in those little games []
U1: you have a little go for it but []
U1: that's right this is another little []
U1: with that strength of confidence i mean []
U1: i i'll be surprised if it's argon i []
U1: think it is for him so []
U1: that way we'll see what happens but []
U1: should we []
U1: retire []
U1: i think so yeah okay well well done []
U1: cheers thank you so i hope i haven't []
U1: thank you chris oh give a big hand they []
U1: go away jack is so relieved []
U1: they go away sixteen thousand pounds []
U1: better huh []
U1: and as jack says that's it that's []
U1: universally sorted that's everything []
U1: paid for for the next three years i can []
U1: tell you []
U1: if you had said fluorine []
U1: you'd no longer have well you no longer []
U1: have to make the right decision yeah []
U1: you would now have 32 000 pounds []
U1: later the hot seat is the only place to []
U1: be choose your friends carefully because []
U1: chris tarrant may well be putting you []
U1: all on the spot in classic who wants to []
U1: be a millionaire tonight at 9. []
U1: you []
